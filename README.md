# 🛡️ Scroll of Valor – Knight Registration Form

Welcome, noble traveler! This is my **first HTML project**, a themed registration form for aspiring knights who seek honor, adventure, and maybe a dragon or two.

## ⚔️ About the Project

**Scroll of Valor** is a fun, medieval-fantasy styled HTML form where users can register as knights by entering details like:

- 🏰 Knight Name, Title & Clan  
- ⚔️ Preferred Weapon, Mount & Battle Experience  
- 🧙 Magical Powers, Allegiances & Oaths  
- 🍗 Battlefield Snacks and Armor Size  
- ✍️ Final Signature and Sacred Oath  

All written in pure HTML — no CSS or JavaScript (yet!).  
This project helped me learn about:

- Form elements (`input`, `select`, `textarea`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `button`)
- Attribute usage (`name`, `id`, `value`, `required`, `placeholder`)
- Structuring and organizing a multi-section form
